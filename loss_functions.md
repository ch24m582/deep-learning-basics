# Loss Functions

Loss functions measure how well a neural network's predictions match the target values.

## Common Loss Functions

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** For regression tasks
- **Cross-Entropy Loss:** For classification tasks

## Example: MSE

$$MSE = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2$$
